Predicted category using (Vectorization, t-SNE and KMeans) for "Computer graphics is a field focused on generating and manipulating visual content using computational techniques.
It involves concepts like rasterization, rendering, shading, and texture mapping to create realistic or stylized images.
Technologies such as OpenGL and DirectX enable hardware-accelerated graphics, while transformations, projections,
and matrices support 2D and 3D modeling. Advanced topics include ray tracing,
anti-aliasing, GPU programming, and real-time animation for simulations, video games, and visual effects." is (comp.graphics)
